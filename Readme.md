# Morpheus for Ancient Greek


Simple practical tibetan text analyzer on a top of [electron.js](https://github.com/electron/electron)

Homepage: http://diglossa.org/

Just copy (Ctrl-C) any Tibetan text in UTF-8 (or any part of it) from anywhere on the desktop, and get the result. Then hover the mouse cursor over the analyzed text.

Or Shift-mouse to view the phonetic transcription (look https://github.com/mbykov/cholok for explanations).
